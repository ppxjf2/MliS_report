This paper outlines the process and intricacies that were explored with creating a drone that is controlled autonomously through reinforcement methods. The method implemented is a state-action value algorithm with a soft policy to ensure all states have a non-zero probability of being taken. This is kept to the bounds of a defined space and set of targets and a specified amount of timesteps. [RESULT] [CONCLUSION]
