This paper outlines the process and intricacies that were explored with creating a drone that is controlled autonomously through reinforcement methods. The method implemented is a state-action value algorithm with a soft policy\cite{ARXIVEXAMPLE} to ensure all states have a non-zero probability of being taken. This is kept to the bounds of a defined space and set of targets and a specified amount of timesteps. The data demonstrated a logarithmic improvement in the drones performance over epochs. In our sample of completed simulations, it performed better than the heuristic model after an average of 2596 Epochs. Further simulation is required for statistical significance in demonstrating better performance than the Heuristic model.
