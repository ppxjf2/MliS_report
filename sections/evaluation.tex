\section{Evaluation}

This graph demonstrates strong correlation between the cumulative reward function and the number of targets hit suggesting it is a good estimator for the performance of the drone. \Cref{fig:fig1} 

The best fit logarithmic model suggests that we would expect the simulation to overtake the heuristic model with its average simulation after 2596 epochs. \Cref{fig:fig2} 

However, the model has a large Mean Squared Error due to only averaging over 5 simulations.
The model has a residual standard deviation of 711.29847146, and we would therefore require the cumulative reward to be 7028 for the heuristic model's result to lie outside of 3 standard deviations.
The model therefore suggests that after 12395 epochs we would expect any results worse than the heuristic algorithm to be anomalies.
Due to our model only being trained to 5000 epochs, however, the model may struggle to be representative of the data at this point.
