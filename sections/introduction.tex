Drones have become a useful tool in the modern era, with many applications such as agriculture, photography and warfare. Defining movement of a drone is a non-trivial task with many variables to consider. While there are many ways to control a drone such as user controlled, this project focuses on implementing autonomous flight for a 2d simulated drone. This drone will fly within a defined space to hit a number of predefined targets. The drone is controlled using two motors which define the thrust independently allowing for navigation, and is subject to gravity and drag forces on rotation and planar motion. The task is to write a flight controller which uses reinforcement learning to have the drone traverse space to hit as many targets as it can within a specified amount of time.
