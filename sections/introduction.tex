Drones in the current age are becoming more and more popular, encouraging the public to build their own versions of these drones from their homes. Usually drones are programmed with a flight controller to define its movements for a given task. While there are many ways to control a drone such as user controlled, this project focuses on implementing autonomous flight in which the drone will fly within a defined space to hit a number of targets. The drone is controlled using two motors which define the thrust independently allowing for navigation. The task is to write a flight controller which uses reinforcement learning to have the drone traverse the space to hit as many targets as it can within a specified amount of time.
